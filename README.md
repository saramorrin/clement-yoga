# Site Design Considerations
### Client Expectations

The basic functions requested by the client were:
- Picture examples of the kinds of practices offered
- A simple meditation demonstration to give potential clients some information to take away from the site which could be built upon should they wish to join
- Convey a message of finding a way to deliver a more balanced, tranquil and mindful way of life through the practices and meditation techniques on offer.
- Links to all social media channels as currently most clients are directed to the business from these
- Contact page

The client would like to have the ability to add further functionality at a later point to include a class timetable for yoga classes, an online booking form for yoga classes and a dedicated retreat page to demonstrate past retreat events. 

The client would like the website to convey a welcoming, serene and tranquil tone, focusing on using cool pink and grey based hues.
