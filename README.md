Clement Yoga also offers personalied meditation techniques and yoga retreats to its clients.

Users of the site will be able to see the services which Clement Yoga offer, along with a step by step simple meditation techique to follow at home and a contact page to get in touch for further details.

# Site Design Considerations
### Client Expectations

The basic functions requested by the client were:
- Picture examples of the kinds of practices offered
- A simple meditation demonstration to give potiental clients some information to take away from the site which could be built upon should they wish to join

The client would like to have the ability to add further functionality at a later point to include a class timetable for yoga classes, an online booking form for yoga classes and a deciated retreat page to demonstarte past retreat events.
